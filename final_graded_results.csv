how is model compactness measured?,"[""en with the same grapheme in different languages. These phonemes tend to be phonetically similar to each other.\n\nPerhaps the structure of the phoneme embedding space is what leads to our models' very good performance on WER 100. Even when the model's first predicted pronunciation is not correct, it tends to assign more probability mass to guesses that are more similar to the correct one.ings for languages written in the Latin alphabet. Given a short text in a language, the model predicts the language's orthographic rules. To create phonemic context features from the short text, the model naïvely maps graphemes to IPA symbols written with the same character, and uses the features of these symbols to learn an approximation of the phonotactic constraints of the language.s with ambiguous orthographies is such a problem. Multilingual g2p, in which the various languages have similar but different and possibly contradictory spelling rules, can be seen as an extreme case of that. Therefore, a data-driven sequence-to-sequence model is a natural choice.\n\n\n## Encoder–Decoder Models\n\nIn order to find the best phoneme sequence, we use a neural encoder–decoder model with attention BIBREF9 .""]","I'm sorry, but the provided documents do not contain information on how model compactness is measured.",Using file size on disk,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
